File: main.py
Purpose: Entry point for the Minesweeper application. Wires together the core components — BoardManager (board state),
GameLogic (rules), and GameGUI (Tkinter UI) — then starts the Tk event loop.

Flow:
    1) Create BoardManager with fixed grid size (10x10) and initial mine count.
    2) Create GameLogic bound to that BoardManager (defers mines until first click).
    3) Create GameGUI bound to GameLogic (renders grid, handles clicks/flags).
    4) Run the Tkinter main loop.

Inputs: None

Outputs: Launches a Tkinter window that renders the Minesweeper UI.
